The UML diagrams were generated usign the ObjectAid Eclipse extension.

The tool generates UML elements from the source code: classes, interfaces and the relationships between them, but doesn't draw an actual diagram, this last step was done manually through drag and drop. We have prepared diagrams describing all components of the application at different levels of detail. Overall the diagrams describe all the classes of our project. No relationship between classes has been removed or added from those that were generated automatically.
